//Features of the Project -
//If you have numerous Files in a folder and they are not Properly arranged
//So you can use this tool to arrange them in specific directory according to their extensions
// like text files will go into text File Folder .exe files will go into application folder and so on
// so at the end you will have a arranged set of files in specific folders

// let firstNumber = process.argv[2]
// let secondNumber = process.argv[3]

// console.log(Number(firstNumber) + Number(secondNumber))
